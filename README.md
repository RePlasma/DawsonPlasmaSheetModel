  >> are the commands to run the scripts

  ---------------------------
  /breakcold
  	Wavebreaking in a cold plasma. Considers the electron sheet at the far left flowing to the right with constant velocity. This velocity is constantly fixed to be the same.

  	breakcold_aux.m - function will return results of the system for a given parameters including the sheet velocity
  	breakcold.m - uses the function in breakcold_aux.m to calculate the maximum value of the electric field, of the maximum velocity and number of collision and produce a plot.

  >> breakcold

  ---------------------------
  /conservation
  	Conservation of energy study for warm plasmas with a waterbag distribution.

  	conservation_aux.m - function will return error of energy of the system for a given parameters
  	conservation.m - uses the function in conservation_aux.m to obtain a plot for error of the energy

  >> conservation

  ---------------------------
  /drag
  	Drag on a fast sheet.

  	Conservation of energy study for warm plasmas with a waterbag distribution.

  	drag_aux.m - calculates results for a a system where the left particle as a given initial velocity.
  	drag.m - get plot of the sheet velocity with time for different initial velocities.

  >> drag

  ---------------------------
  /thermalize
  	Evolution of a waterbag towards a maxwellian.

  	thermalize.m - returns plot of velocity distribution for the initial and final time

  >> thermalize

  ---------------------------
  /wakefield
  	Shape of the electric field from an external driver.


  >> wakefield

  ---------------------------
  /waterbag
  	Generation of velocity distributions (waterbag and maxwellian).

  >> waterbag

  ---------------------------
  /wavelength
  	Get wavelength from phasespace of the wake of an external driver plasma sheet.

  >> wavelength
